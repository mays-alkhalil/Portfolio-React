      "My journey in tech began with curiosity about how digital systems shape the way we live and learn. I earned my degree in Computer Engineering from Al-Balqa Applied University with a “Very Good” GPA, and quickly discovered my passion for turning ideas into seamless, interactive web experiences.",
      "During my Full Stack Development training at Orange Academy, I worked on collaborative, real-world projects that honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies — including React, Laravel, PHP, MySQL, and Node.js. My earlier 280-hour training at Pio-Tech gave me exposure to scalable architectures and user-centric software solutions.",
      "Later, I expanded into e-learning systems, working as a Moodle developer to design, customize, and deploy educational platforms for diverse learners. I also developed deep experience in automation workflows using n8n — integrating APIs and processes to enhance efficiency and scalability.",
      "Outside of coding, I’m committed to community impact. I founded the initiative “Kitabek Befeed Gheirak” to promote book exchange among youth, and contributed to projects producing audiobooks for visually impaired students. These experiences strengthened my leadership, collaboration, and communication skills.",
      "Today, I focus on building human-centered, accessible, and efficient web solutions — combining my expertise in development, automation, and education to make technology truly meaningful.",
